### (or, ‘Why I Chose Software Development’)

*tl;dr:*

*The world is shifting back to a way of life where people provide for themselves what agricultural giants, business and industry used to provide. Technology is making this easier than ever before with 3D printing, smart homes, alternative energy, soil-free farming, and much more. With the internet of things, all of this can easily be connected through software and makers are at the front of the line designing and developing new systems and hardware to make the do-it-yourself culture more inclusive and attainable for everyone. This is why I continue to choose software development.*

### Hello out there!

As this is my first post during my time as a student in the Online Web Developer Program through the Flatiron School, I feel the need to include a little bit about myself.

My name is Chantel Lowe, but I would much prefer that you call me Nik. I'm from a small town in Ohio, and that's where I currently reside. I have a variety of interests, most of which have led me to embrace the diy lifestyle. I strongly connect with the maker subculture, and after years of making in the non-technical arena, I've decided it's time to get serious about understanding software and development best practices to take my passion for making and general creative experimentation to the next level.

I first got interested in code and software-related technology on accident. As a 24 year old, I am a true millennial. An early 90s baby who remembers Tom on Myspace. Back when static sites rules the web and HTML and CSS were essentially all people seemed to use, people just s smidge older than my middle school-aged self were making real money designing and building custom Myspace pages for strangers all over the world. I, of course, thought I could replicate this simple business model, if only I had the skills necessary (HTML and CSS). The internet, slow as it was, taught me everything I needed to know to get started. Middle school me jumped in head first, and you know what? After all of the studying I did for weeks and weeks, I was too anxious to share any of it with the world. I never even updated my own Myspace page. 

That's essentially the behavior I've kept over the years. Study, study, study. Feel incompetent in my abilities. Never publish any of my work. What I didn't realize was that what I was really dealing with internally all this time was actually “imposter syndrome", or “a pervasive feeling of self-doubt, insecurity, or fraudulence despite often overwhelming evidence to the contrary” (Hendriksen, 2015). Not knowing what I was dealing with would lead me to halt my learning every time, causing me to reverse my progression for whenever I decided to later pick it back up.

### Flatiron School

Which leads me to why I'm here at Flatiron School learning software development online. I'm 24 years old now, and I've had a lot of time to learn about myself and others. A lot of time has been spent on self-reflection and introspection. I spent 4 years in a Social Work program, and that's basically all we do other than our field work requirements. All of this time spent focusing on my inner self reminded me of who I was and what I wanted out of life.

So who and what am I? I'm a maker. I've always been a maker. Building and creating in the physical and digital worlds is what keeps me going. Yes, I would like to get a job or preferably start a business that leaves me with a comfortable lifestyle, but that's not the primary goal for me. I chose and continue to choose software because it will allow me to continue to create as technology advances our world into the next era of innovation.

### Makers *will* rule the world.

Makers do rule the world, in my honest opinion. It just seems to be a bit on the down low at the moment. Whether from a micro perspective--with a kid in a school library makerspace with their first 3D printer--or in the macro--with a business strategist trying to convince his colleagues of the need to consider a shift in the market that relabels consumers as makers/fixers/do-it-yourselfers and figures out how to better serve this ever-growing community.

For me, learning software is the next step in that journey.
